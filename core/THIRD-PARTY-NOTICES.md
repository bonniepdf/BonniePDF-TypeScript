# Third-Party Notices

`@bonniepdf/core` is built with no runtime dependencies of its own, but a
small number of internal modules are derived from, or ported from,
third-party open-source software. This file lists each of those components
and reproduces the licence under which the original work was released, as
required by the respective licence terms.

When adding a new component derived from third-party code (e.g. a barcode
symbology, a compression routine, a font-handling helper), append a new
section below following the same format: name the component, state where
the derived files live, link to the upstream project, and reproduce the
upstream licence text in full and unmodified.

This file covers the published `@bonniepdf/core` package. Fonts bundled with the
example catalogue (the Noto families under `examples/assets/fonts/`) are not part
of that package; their licence travels with them as `OFL.txt` in the same folder.

## QR Code encoder

- **Files:** `core/src/Elements/Shapes/QrCodeEncoder.ts`,
  `core/src/Elements/Shapes/QrSegment.ts`
- **Upstream project:** [Project Nayuki - QR Code generator library](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library)
- **Upstream source:** https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator
- **Licence:** MIT License
- **Nature of use:** `QrCodeEncoder.ts` and `QrSegment.ts` are a TypeScript
  port (adapted to BonniePDF's `Element` / `ICanvas` rendering conventions)
  of Project Nayuki's `qrcodegen.ts` QR Code encoder (ISO/IEC 18004 Model 2).
  This mirrors the porting relationship of the .NET reference implementation,
  whose `QrCodeEncoder.cs` / `QrSegment.cs` are derived from the same
  upstream source - see the [.NET notices](https://github.com/BonniePDF/BonniePDF-NET/blob/master/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md). The
  encoding algorithms - version selection, Reed-Solomon error correction,
  mask penalty scoring, function-pattern drawing, and codeword interleaving -
  originate from the upstream project.

## Data Matrix encoder

- **Files:** `core/src/Elements/Shapes/DataMatrixEncoder.ts`
- **Upstream project:** [datalog/datamatrix-svg](https://github.com/datalog/datamatrix-svg)
- **Licence:** MIT License
- **Nature of use:** `DataMatrixEncoder.ts` is a TypeScript port of the upstream
  `datamatrix.js` Data Matrix (ECC200, ISO/IEC 16022) encoder. The encodation
  scheme selection (ASCII, C40, Text, X12, EDIFACT, Base-256), the Reed-Solomon
  error correction and the module placement originate from the upstream
  project. The upstream SVG/DOM rendering layer is not used: BonniePDF draws the
  matrix as vector rectangles through its own `DataMatrix` element. The .NET
  implementation ports the same upstream source - see the
  [.NET notices](https://github.com/BonniePDF/BonniePDF-NET/blob/master/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

## Liberation fonts

- **Files:** `core/assets/fonts/Liberation*.ttf` (Sans, Serif, Mono -
  Regular/Bold/Italic/BoldItalic), shipped in the published `@bonniepdf/core`
  package.
- **Upstream project:** [Liberation Fonts](https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts)
- **Licence:** SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 (see
  [`core/assets/fonts/OFL.txt`](assets/fonts/OFL.txt)).
- **Nature of use:** The Liberation fonts are metric-compatible substitutes for
  the standard-14 PDF fonts (Helvetica/Times/Courier). They are bundled so that
  PDF/A and PDF/UA output can embed real glyph outlines without relying on
  machine-installed fonts. The fonts are redistributed unmodified. This mirrors
  the .NET implementation, which embeds the same fonts - see the
  [.NET notices](https://github.com/BonniePDF/BonniePDF-NET/blob/master/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
